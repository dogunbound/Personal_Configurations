====== Hashing ======
Created Thursday 18 June 2020
All hashing is is a way to immediately get to an index in the hash table using a formula

i.e.:
{{./pasted_image.png}}

The numbers returned are both keys and indexes.
Each index in the array is called a bucket












Collisions and overflow

If two keys lead to the same bucket, we have a collision
If we have too many collisions, we get overflow and can't insert any more items


How to deal with collisions:
probing strategies.


Open addressing:
Quadratic probing
rehashing
random probing 
linear probing



Linear probing: if location is occupied, move to the next index.

Problem with linear probing: clustering. 






Chaining:
2D array or linked list off of array.
Prevents clustering, and the need for open addressing.

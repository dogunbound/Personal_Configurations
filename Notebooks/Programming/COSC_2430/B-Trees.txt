{{./pasted_image.png}}

array for each node



visit left, visit node, visit right.



search is similar to binary tree.




insertion into a b-tree 
if key is already there: output error
if key not in tree: search terminates at a leaf
record insreted into the leaf
	if leaf full: split node into two nodes
	median key moved to parent node
Splitting can propagate upward


deletion
case 1:
	item is in leaf with more than the minimum number of elements
		delete item
case 2:
	item is in leaf with just the minumum number of elements
		if sibling node has more than the minimum number of keys, push item to parent and item from parent to node, then delete
		if sibling node has just the minimum number of keys, merge and move stuff around
case 3:
	item is in node
	pick child to swap it down
	then delete 70
	Check for case 1 and 2.

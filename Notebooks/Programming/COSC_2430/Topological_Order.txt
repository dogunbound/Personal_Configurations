====== Topological Order ======
Created Thursday 25 June 2020

Topological order
Order in which nodes should be visited so that every predecessor is visited before its successors
Example: the nodesw of G represent courses in a major program. Predecessors to a node represent its prerequisites
Topological oder can be determined using breadth-first or depth-first algorithms
Assumption: the graph has no cycles

BFT Topological
1. Create array predCount and initialize it so that predCount[i] = number of predecessors of vertex v
2. initialize queue and add vertices with no predecessors
3. while queue is not empty
	a. remove first element u
	b. add u to topologicalOrder array
	c. decrtement predecessor counts of successors of u
		1. if count goes to 0, add successor to queue

A bag or multi-set is like a set, but an alement mmay appear more than once
	Example: {a,b,c,a} is a bag. {a,b,c} is a bag that is also a set


LIKE, is a partial match. Similar to =.
	WHERE FNAME = 'J%'. 
	That is the like operator, nice.
	AND operator to conjunct more of these wheres:
	WHERE FNAME = 'J%'
	AND LNAME = 'S%'
	
	Two reserved characters are used: % or * replaces an arbitrary number of characters, and _ replaces a single arbitrary character

JOIN
	example:
		FROM employee JOIN department ON dnumber=dno
		
		employee T1 JOIN employee T2 ON t1.dno=T2.dno



Aliasing
	use AS keyword t specify aliases.
	aliases are used to save data 


INSERT 
	Cannot insert if table has not been created.
	Using INSERT into select, like what I did on the first homework. 
	Very useful.

DELETE
	EX:

UPDATE
	EX:
		{{./pasted_image003.png}}

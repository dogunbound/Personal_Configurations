Twos Complement
{{./pasted_image001.png}}Failures before twos complement{{./pasted_image002.png}}another set of negative vs positives with twos complement 
These don't work well with arithmetic
This one works well with arithmtic

{{./pasted_image003.png}} Some arithmetic  with this table: {{./pasted_image004.png}}{{./pasted_image005.png}}These are all additions


Twos complement definition:
flip the 1s and 0s, and add a 1 to the end of it.
so 1101 twos complement = 0010
{{./pasted_image006.png}}Range, should be superscript



Arithmetic gets funky, add a number together bigger than max int, you get a negative number
{{./pasted_image007.png}}It goes around a loop pretty much

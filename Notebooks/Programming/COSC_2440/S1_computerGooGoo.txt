Silicon is used to make processors

To decrease transistor size, it uses lenses to make the light more focused and smaller. 
The chemicals can make silicon conductive
The light makes channels, the chemicals fill those channels and make that channel conductive. 



Impurities are represented with dotted boxes. 
The rectangular box blocks electron flow.
It is possible that the impurities completely block the path.
Dead dyes come from that.

Defining performance. It can be quite tricky to define.
**throughput** is the most important performance aspect out of all other performance metrics.


Every process needs a clock cycle time to determine when the next execution should be:

Speeding up cpus also involve speeding up memory, traces, and other unexpected reasons.


to speed up processes without worrying about cycle time, block off per types of instruction

each block represents a different mix of instructions, the longer, the longer the time. if your program has an instance where it has a 3pcs, it'll tell the cpu that wait 3 pcs before doing another process.

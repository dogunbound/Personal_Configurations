{{./pasted_image.png}} This is fr  for peroblems with yes/no answers
CF: context-free

you go circle to circle.

More difficult the further out the you go.

We need to know how to find out what level of difficulty our problem is.


Models of computation
	- finite representation

1. mach8ine / automata
	a. recognizer
2. grammer
3. recursive function theory (Mathematics)

Solvable computation models. Oh this is easy to understand because I had a good teacher for discrete.

I have no idea what this is for.

{{./pasted_image006.png}}REPLACE EPSILON WITH SIGMA for the above


We need to know set theory.
